# What is the Hand Gesture Recognition?

Gesture recognition is a topic in computer science and language technology with the goal of interpreting human gestures via mathematical algorithms. Gestures can originate from any bodily motion or state but commonly originate from the face or hand. A camera feeds image data into a sensing device that is connected to a computer. The sensing device typically uses an infrared sensor or projector for the purpose of calculating depth,
Specially designed software identifies meaningful gestures from a predetermined gesture library where each gesture is matched to a computer command.
The software then correlates each registered real-time gesture, interprets the gesture and uses the library to identify meaningful gestures that match the library.

# What is the cosine rule?

## For any triangle:

a, b and c are sides.
C is the angle opposite side c
The Law of Cosines (also called the Cosine Rule) says:
c2 = a2 + b2 âˆ’ 2ab cos(C)
